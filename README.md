Detours are what make compilations possible, without these you will not be able to construct the .dll or .exe for the program, you can find the detours by clicking [here](). 

Detours are to be placed in your `VS2019` file folders, proceed with placing `Detours.lib` in any Lib (Library) folder, then relocate the `Detours.h` file to all header or include folders. if done correctly you should be able to build .dll in both x86 and x64 release and debug, debug is for testing purposes only, releasing a debug build publically will most likely cause game crashes when using/injecting said .dll
